    <b>Cool</b> or <b>Not?</b> with <strong>DINOSAURS!!!</strong>
  </h1>
  <p>
    You know that morally ambiguous game called "Hot or Not"? This is like that (sort of, more of a guessing game actually), but... with dinosaurs!
  </p>
  <p>
    Believe it or not, some dinosaurs were objectively cool, and others not so much. In this game, you get to guess which was which and find out at the end if you're right!
