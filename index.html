  <p>
    Remember that morally ambiguous game called "Hot or Not"? This is like that (sort of), but... with dinosaurs!
  </p>
  <p>
    Believe it or not, some dinosaurs were objectively hot, and others were not. In this game, you get to guess which ones were which, and you'll find out at the end if you're right!
